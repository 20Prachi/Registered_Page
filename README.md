Building a registration page requires careful attention to input validation, sanitization, and database checks to ensure the data entered is both secure and correctly stored.

Input Validation
The first step is validating the user input to ensure that it adheres to the expected format and constraints. For example, checking if an email address is in the correct format (e.g., example@example.com). Additionally, passwords should be validated to ensure they meet security standards, such as a minimum length, including uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Validation also includes checking that required fields (like name, email, and password) are not left empty. This ensures that the user provides the necessary data to create an account and that the data is in the correct form.

Sanitization
After validation, sanitization is crucial to protect the application from malicious input such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This process involves cleaning the input by removing or escaping potentially harmful characters. For instance, characters like <script> or -- can be used for XSS or SQL injection attacks, so they need to be sanitized before inserting the data into the database. In PHP, functions like htmlspecialchars or mysqli_real_escape_string can be used to sanitize input, preventing malicious code from being executed on the server or in the browser.

Database Existence Check
Before storing the registration data in the database, it’s essential to check whether the user already exists to prevent duplicate entries. For example, a query should be made to the database to check if the email address or username is already in use. This can be done by checking the database for matching records. If a match is found, an appropriate error message, like "Email already in use," should be returned to the user. This step ensures that each user has a unique identifier and helps maintain data integrity.

By combining these steps—input validation, sanitization, and checking for existing data—you ensure that the registration page is both functional and secure, providing a safe experience for users while protecting the application from common security vulnerabilities.
